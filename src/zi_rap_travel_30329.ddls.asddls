       To ensure uniform data processing on the consumer side, @Semantics annotations are used to enrich some of the fields â€“ i.e. the currency fields and the administrative fields in the present scenario.
The currency key field CurrencyCode is specified as the reference field of the currency fields BookingFee and TotalPrice using the annotation @Semantics.amount.currencyCode.
The annotation of the administrative data is a preparation step for week 3, where the transactional behavior of the Travel List Report app will be enabled. These annotations are required to allow the automatic update of the fields on every operation.
